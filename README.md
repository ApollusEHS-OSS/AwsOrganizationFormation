## Installation

```
> npm i aws-organization-formation
```

## Getting started
The intended user for this tool is anyone that manages an [AWS Organizations](https://aws.amazon.com/organizations/). You might already have an Organization set up using a different tool (e.g. landingzone, control tower) or you might want to start from scratch. Either way: this tool helps you manage you AWS Organizations resources and Cloudformation templates across your AWS Accounts.

### I already have an AWS Organization

Great! you might not only already have an AWS Organization but also know some of the challanges when managing other resources (CoudTrail, GuardDuty, centralized logging, shared services) across your accounts.

To get started you first need an ``org-formation`` template that describes all your Organization resources such as [Accounts](./docs/organization-resources.md#account), [OUs](./docs/organization-resources.md#organizationalunit) and [SCPs](docs/organization-resources.md#servicecontrolpolicy).

After [Installation](#installation) you can generate this file using the following command:

```
> org-formation init organization.yml  --region us-east-1 [--profile org-master-account]
```

You can make changes to the file you generated  and upate your organization using the ``update`` commmand. Alternatively you can run ``create-change-set`` and ``update-change-set``. Read more in the [cli reference](docs/cli-reference.md)

Once you got the hang of managing organization resources, use these organization resources to write smarter cloudformation that allows you to provision resources across your organization. Read more [about managing resources across accounts](docs/cloudformation-resources.md).
